    <h2 class="article-title">What Makes a School Decide to Have a Snow Day?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        Ever wonder what actually leads a school district to call off classes for snow?
        It's not just about how many inches fall overnight. School administrators must
        weigh a number of factors many of which can be unpredictable. And that’s exactly
        what tools like the <em>Snow Day Calculator</em> try to replicate using data.
      </p>

      <h3>1 · Road Conditions and Safety Risks</h3>
      <p>
        The top priority for any school district is student safety. If buses or parents
        can’t safely navigate roads due to snow, ice, or poor visibility, that’s a red
        flag. Even if only part of a county is impacted, transportation risks can trigger
        district-wide closures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where an <em>AI snow day calculator</em> becomes helpful it doesn't just
        count snowfall, but also factors in ice alerts, wind chill, and timing. The goal?
        Replicate the real decisions superintendents face at 4 a.m.
      </p>

      <h3>2 · Timing of the Snowfall</h3>
      <p>
        Snow that falls overnight or early morning is much more disruptive than the same
        amount arriving at 2 p.m. That’s why many predictions in the
        <em>snow day calculator 2024</em> model prioritize hourly forecasts to better
        estimate impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some schools may delay opening if plows need time. Others go fully remote. The
        <em>snow day calculator app</em> gives users a real-time look at these
        probabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>3 · Historical Closure Trends</h3>
      <p>
        One overlooked factor in predicting snow days is the district’s own past
        behavior. For example, in Michigan, districts often remain open with 3–4 inches
        of snow. In other areas, that much snow would certainly mean closure.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why the <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> model and our Canada version
        too use past decisions to personalize your <em>snow day percentage calculator</em>
        result.
      </p>

      <h3>4 · Infrastructure & Readiness</h3>
      <p>
        Does the district have enough plows? Are the sidewalks and parking lots salted?
        Urban areas might stay open more easily than rural towns with fewer resources.
        For <em>college campuses</em>, pedestrian safety plays a huge role.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>snow day calculator college</em> model evaluates more than road safety it
        considers campus walkability, dorm status, and staff availability.
      </p>

      <h3>5 · What Makes the Calculator So Accurate?</h3>
      <p>
        When people ask, “<em>Is the snow day calculator accurate?</em>” the answer lies
        in how deeply it mirrors these real-world decisions. Our <em>snow day predictor
        calculator</em> uses a machine learning model trained on years of closures,
        forecasts from AccuWeather, and live user feedback to refine results in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're using the <em>snow.day calculator</em> on your browser or our
        mobile app, the system behind it ranks among the <em>most accurate snow day
        calculators</em> available.
      </p>

      <h3>6 · So, What Really Decides a Snow Day?</h3>
      <p>
        In short: it’s a mix of data, judgment, and local norms. There’s no universal
        rule, but with the <em>snow day chance calculator</em>, you get a highly informed
        estimate tailored to your ZIP code or full address.
      </p>
      <p>
        For 2025 and beyond, our <em>snow day calculator formula</em> will keep learning.
        And as storms evolve, so will the AI helping you predict whether you’ll need your
        backpack… or your boots.
