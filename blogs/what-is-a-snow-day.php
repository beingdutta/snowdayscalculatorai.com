    <h2 class="article-title">What Is a Snow Day?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        For students, teachers, and even parents, there are few words more exciting in winter than:
        “snow day.” But what exactly qualifies as a snow day, and how is it decided?
        That’s where tools like the <em>snow day calculator</em> can help provide clarity fast.
      </p>

      <h3>Defining a Snow Day</h3>
      <p>
        A snow day is an unexpected school or work closure caused by severe winter weather.
        This could mean heavy snow, ice storms, dangerously low temperatures, or hazardous road conditions.
        Snow days are typically declared by school administrators, often in the early morning hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        But predicting one isn’t always easy and that’s why millions now rely on the
        <em>AI snow day calculator</em> for a data-driven forecast.
      </p>

      <h3>Who Decides Snow Days And Why?</h3>
      <p>
        District superintendents or school officials evaluate multiple factors before declaring a closure:
        local snowfall, ice levels, plow schedules, wind chills, and even past closure trends.
        That’s why the <em>snow day calculator formula</em> takes more than just inches into account.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> uses very different criteria than
        what you'd see in Texas or North Carolina. In snowy regions, schools may stay open with 4–6 inches
        on the ground, while southern districts might close over an inch of slush or a freezing drizzle.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Snow Day Calculator Works</h3>
      <p>
        Our <em>snow day chance calculator</em> uses real-time weather inputs from trusted providers like
        <em>AccuWeather</em>, school closure history, elevation data, and AI-driven models to predict
        the chance of school being canceled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're searching for “<em>snow.day calculator</em>,” “<em>snow day calculator app</em>,”
        or “<em>snow day calculator 2024</em>,” you're accessing one of the most reliable
        closure predictors on the web.
