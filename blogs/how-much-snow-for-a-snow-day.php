    <h2 class="article-title">How Much Snow Does It Take to Have a Snow Day at School?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        One of the most common winter questions from students and parents alike:
        “How many inches of snow does it take to cancel school?”
        The truth is, there’s no single number that applies everywhere but with the help
        of modern tools like the <em>Snow Day Calculator</em>, you can find out what
        matters most for your location.
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding the Threshold: It’s Not Just About Inches</h3>
      <p>
        While many people assume a snow day happens after 3–5 inches of snow, the real
        decision depends on several factors like road clearing speed, timing of snowfall,
        ice conditions, wind chill, and even school policy history.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why the <em>snow day chance calculator</em> doesn’t just consider total
        accumulation. It evaluates dozens of variables in real time to predict
        cancellations with surprising accuracy.
      </p>

      <h3>Different Schools, Different Standards</h3>
      <p>
        In states like Michigan or Minnesota, a school might remain open through 6 inches
        or more. But in southern states, even 1–2 inches or the mere threat of ice can
        trigger closures. That’s why the <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> gives
        vastly different results than in, say, Georgia or Texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some colleges are even more snow-resistant. For example, the <em>snow day calculator college</em> model
        factors in pedestrian infrastructure and campus maintenance capabilities, which
        can differ from public K–12 districts.
      </p>

      <h3>How the AI Snow Day Predictor Works</h3>
      <p>
        Our system uses a proprietary <em>snow day calculator formula</em> that combines
        real-time weather data (including sources like AccuWeather), local closure
        history, elevation, and neighborhood response rates. The result? A personalized
        snow day percentage that updates hourly.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why more people trust our platform as the <em>best snow day calculator</em>
          because it doesn’t guess, it learns. And it works across the U.S. and Canada.
      </p>

      <h3>How Much Snow Is “Enough” for a Day Off?</h3>
      <p>
        Here’s a general estimate based on national averages from our data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>❄️ 1–2 inches: Rare closures unless paired with ice or extreme cold</li>
        <li>❄️ 3–4 inches: Possible closure in moderate-risk districts</li>
        <li>❄️ 5–6 inches: High probability of cancellation in most areas</li>
        <li>❄️ 6+ inches: Strong snow day probability in nearly all districts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But again, these are just patterns. Your district’s response may vary and that’s
        why you need a smarter tool to estimate your odds.
      </p>

      <h3>How Accurate Is the Snow Day Calculator?</h3>
      <p>
