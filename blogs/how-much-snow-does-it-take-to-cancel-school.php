    <h2 class="article-title">How Much Snow Does It Take to Cancel School?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        Every winter, students across the U.S. and Canada wake up and ask the same question:
        “How much snow does it take to cancel school?”
        The answer depends on where you live, how your district operates, and what weather conditions are coming your way.
        Luckily, tools like the <em>snow day calculator</em> can help break it down.
      </p>

      <h3>There’s No Universal Number</h3>
      <p>
        While 3–6 inches of snow might seem like a likely threshold, there's no nationwide rule.
        Some schools close at just 1 inch of snow  others stay open with 7+ inches.
        Factors like road clearing, ice, temperature, wind chill, and timing all play a role.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why the <em>AI snow day calculator</em> uses a complex <em>snow day calculator formula</em>
        to predict whether your school might cancel tomorrow.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Location Matters</h3>
      <p>
        In snowy northern states like Minnesota or Michigan, districts are well-prepared and less likely to close.
        But in places like Georgia or Tennessee, even a light snow dusting  or a forecast of freezing rain  
        can shut schools down. The <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> uses different thresholds than
        the <em>snow day calculator Canada</em> or southern states.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>snow day calculator college</em> version also takes pedestrian traffic and campus infrastructure
        into account  ideal for students at universities and colleges across the U.S.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Snow Day Calculator Predicts Closures</h3>
      <p>
        Our <em>snow day chance calculator</em> analyzes weather data from providers like
        <em>AccuWeather</em>, road conditions, historic closures, and more.
        The result is a real-time snow day percentage tailored to your ZIP code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re using the <em>snow.day calculator</em>, <em>snow day calculator 2024</em>,
        or the newest <em>snow day calculator 2025</em>, the engine behind it remains the same  
        smart, fast, and incredibly accurate.
      </p>

      <h3>Estimated Snow Day Thresholds by Region</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>❄️ <strong>1–2 inches</strong>: Rare closures unless paired with ice or cold temps</li>
        <li>❄️ <strong>3–4 inches</strong>: Moderate chance in suburban and rural districts</li>
        <li>❄️ <strong>5–6 inches</strong>: High cancellation probability in most areas</li>
        <li>❄️ <strong>6+ inches</strong>: Very high snow day likelihood almost everywhere</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember, these are just patterns. The <em>calculator snow day</em> model helps personalize these numbers
        based on your region.
      </p>
