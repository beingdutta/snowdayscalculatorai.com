        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> When you provide a location (ZIP code or address), we use it to generate a weather forecast. This data is processed anonymously and is not stored or linked to you.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address for Geolocation:</strong> We use your IP address to automatically determine your approximate location (city, region) to provide a personalized greeting. This is done for user experience enhancement and is not stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous, aggregated data about website usage through Google Analytics to understand user behavior and improve our service. Our legal basis for this processing is Legitimate Interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use a functional cookie to identify returning visitors for a personalized greeting. For more details, please see our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. How to Exercise Your Rights</h2>
