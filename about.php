        <h1>About SnowDay Calculator AI</h1>
        <p>Welcome to SnowDay Calculator AI, the web's most trusted and accurate snow day predictor. Our mission is simple: to provide students, parents, and educators with precise, real-time school closure predictions, so you can plan your winter mornings with confidence.</p>

        <h2>Our Technology</h2>
        <p>Founded by a team of weather enthusiasts and data scientists, our platform was born from a desire to move beyond simple snowfall measurements. We knew that a true prediction required a smarter approach. Our proprietary AI model analyzes hundreds of data points, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time weather forecasts from leading providers like the National Weather Service and AccuWeather.</li>
            <li>Hyperlocal conditions, such as ice, wind chill, and the timing of precipitation.</li>
            <li>Historical school closure data to understand your district's specific tendencies.</li>
            <li>Geographic factors, including regional infrastructure and elevation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This multi-faceted approach is why our calculator is consistently ranked as one of the most accurate predictors available. It doesn’t just guess—it learns and adapts with every storm.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>We are committed to providing a tool that is not only powerful but also free and accessible to everyone. We believe that reliable information should be readily available, whether you're checking for your local elementary school or a large university campus. Thank you for trusting SnowDay Calculator AI. We hope you enjoy that extra bit of sleep!</p>
